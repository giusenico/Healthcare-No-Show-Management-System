# Healthcare-No-Show-Management-System

🏥 Healthcare No-Show Management System
AI-powered platform to predict patient no-shows and optimize scheduling in healthcare

📅 Developed by: Giuseppe Nicolò
📄 Dataset Used: Medical Appointment No Shows - Kaggle

🚀 Project Overview
This project is an AI-driven web application that predicts the probability of patient no-shows and provides actionable recommendations for scheduling efficiency in healthcare centers, hospitals, and clinics.

Key features include:
✅ Predictive Model (XGBoost) – Forecasts no-show probability for each appointment
✅ Interactive Dashboard – Visualizes patient trends and no-show analytics
✅ AI Recommendations (GPT-4o Mini) – Suggests overbooking slots and reminder notifications
✅ Manual Staff Control – Allows healthcare staff to adjust schedules and send reminders

🎯 How It Works

1️⃣ Data Collection
- The system analyzes historical patient appointment data from Vitoria, Brazil (2016)
- Uses patient demographics, medical history, and past attendance behavior
  
2️⃣ Machine Learning Predictions
- An XGBoost model predicts the likelihood of a patient missing their appointment
- Results are displayed with a real-time probability score
  
3️⃣ AI Recommendations
-Overbooking Suggestions – Identifies time slots where an extra patient can be scheduled
-Reminder Notifications – Recommends sending SMS reminders to high-risk patients

📊 Dashboard Overview
👀 The web application provides an interactive dashboard where healthcare providers can analyze trends and make data-driven decisions.
